I'm Diogo Elói Aguiam and I am an electronics engineer currently finishing my PhD in [Plasma Science and Engineering](https://www.ipfn.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/education/applause).

I love projects where I get to develop a new system from scratch.
In my master thesis I developed a [portable device for eddy currents non-destructive testing](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Portable-heterodyning-Eddy-Currents-Non-Destructive-Testing-system).

I completely changed fields for my PhD work I am now working on a [multichannel microwave reflectometry diagnostic](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Multichannel-X-mode-edge-density-profile-reflectometer-for-the-ICRF-antenna-on-ASDEX-Upgrade) to measure edge plasma density in front of the ICRF antenna on ASDEX Upgrade.


Usually I'm stationed at [Instituto de Plasmas e Fusão Nuclear](https://www.ipfn.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) in [Lisbon, Portugal](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Instituto+Superior+T%C3%A9cnico/@38.7368192,-9.1408937,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd1933a24aa81f17:0x880c7c731a54423!8m2!3d38.7368192!4d-9.138705?hl=en).
Sometimes at [Max-Planck-Institut für Plasmaphysik](https://www.ipp.mpg.de/) in [Munich, Germany](https://www.google.de/maps/place/Max-Planck-Institut+f%C3%BCr+Plasmaphysik/@48.2599601,11.6702013,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x8dfc80469a15e5f6!8m2!3d48.2631877!4d11.6718954?hl=en).

I'm an advocate of [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science).
You don't know everything. Mistakes will be made and you will only get so far by shutting yourself off from other people. Share your data, share your methods, share your codes.
